CBDA has also been shown to help regulate the over release of serotonin that causes severe nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy, and while more thorough research is needed these results are very promising.",

Currently there is little research being conducted on the medical benefits of CBGA, although it has shown extremely promising results when looking at the interaction between CBGA and colon cancer cells. When CBGA was applied directly to colon cancer cells not only did it destroy the cancer cells, but it also stopped the proliferation of new cancer cells. More research is certainly needed, but these preliminary results are extremely encouraging.",

The amount of THC in a cannabis product can vary widely based on the method of consumption and the strain at the source of that product.
